			<h3>MARKETING</h3>
			<p>
				Marketing is a pretty useful skill to have since you can apply it to various different things such

			<h3>HAPPY CUSTOMERS</h3>
			<p>
				Our customers are naturally happy. It has nothing to do with our product or service, they just are
				happy; therefore, we haven't lied or exaggerated. But you could make a case that we are misleading
				our readers...I don't agree though.
